# Movies ETL
## Purpose
Amazing Prime would like the dataset we created to be able to update every day. Britta needs us to create a pathway that takes in the data, then cleans the data, and then loads it into already existing tables. Since we have already created code during our Module, we just need to refactor our code to create one function in order to satisfy Amazing Prime's request. Wikipedia data, Kaggle Metadata and the MovieLens rating data are the files we are working with. This project we will utilize the ETL process to add the data to a PostgreSQL database.
## Deliverable 1: Write an ETL Function to Read Three Data Files
Code: ![ETL Function Test](ETL_function_test.ipynb)
## Deliverable 2: Extract and Transform the Wikipedia Data
Code: ![ETL Clean Wiki Movies Data](ETL_clean_wiki_movies.ipynb)
## Deliverable 3: Extract and Transform the Kaggle Data
Code: ![ETL Clean Kaggle Data](ETL_clean_kaggle_data.ipynb)
## Create the Movie Database
Code: ![ETL Create Database](ETL_create_database.ipynb)
